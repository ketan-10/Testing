em rem 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aDOAMmDHI

usecase: 
if you use em on a parent (first in css) class.

and set the font size latter on, it will use the new size 

so you can reuse the parent class, 
for different forms of child you can just change the font-size


properties like margin-padding inharit same element font-size, when used with 'em'
but if em is used on font-size itself it will inharit from int's parent.

tip: 
padding use 'em' -> specific to that element (button)
margin use 'rem' -> between elements



2) 
use 'rem' for font-size -> so size does not cascade
and 'em' for others  -> reduces the code, just by changeing the font-size, you can have new version of the same element(button) but small. 
// if the element is replicated, it will not 

3) 
max-width : lines should not strich the very long, they are hard to read 
min-height : even for small text height should not go below that;
// NOTE: if min/max is set your might get confused why your height/width is not working -> as it is caped above somewhere

4) 
*{
  box-sizing: border-box;
}


5) 
SAME:

width: 600px; max-width: 100%;
width: 100%; max-width: 600px;
1) width is 600px but it cant go bigger than 100%
2) width is 100% but it cant go bigger than 600px
