AWS: 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv2a_5pNAko0Mijc6mnv04xeOut443Wnk -> VPC 
https://start.jcolemorrison.com/aws-vpc-core-concepts-analogy-guide/ -> VPC


NAT is used to provied only outbound trafic and it's response for private subnet, so the services in private subnet can download updates etc
**
Egress-only Internet gateway works as a NAT gateway, but for IPv6 traffic. 
An egress-only Internet gateway is for use with IPv6 traffic only. 
To enable outbound-only Internet communication over IPv4, use a NAT gateway instead.
**

VPC-> like a city
a private subsection -> logically isolated section

('VPC')<- one to one ->('internet-gateway')
each vpc can have one or zero ineternet gateway
its created by default when VPC is created

('VPC')<- one to many ->[('route-table')]
one vpc can have many route-table
a 'main' route table is created on VPC creation


('route-table')<- one to many ->[('subnet')]
a subnet must have a asigned route-table
if in subnets route table there is internet gateway also then its a public subnet


*'Security groups' are applied to AWS services*
*'Network ACLs' are applied to Subnets*

'Route Table' vs 'Network ACLs' 
-> RT just specifies where corresponding trafic shoud go next, and what is visible
-> NACL specifies what inboud and outbound traffic is allowd
